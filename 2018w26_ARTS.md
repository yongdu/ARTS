#### Algorithm
**Problem** [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/) 
> Link to code [Code Snippets](https://github.com/yongdu/java-code-repo/blob/master/src/yong/du/leetcode/LongestSubstringWithoutRepeatingCharacter.java)

```java
public static int lenthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
		int maxLength = 0;
		int lengthOfString = s.length();
		for (int i = 0;i< lengthOfString ; i++)
		{
			Set<Character> substring = new HashSet<>() ;
			substring.add(s.charAt(i));
			for (int j = i+1; j< lengthOfString; j++)
			{
				Character ch = s.charAt(j);
				if(substring.contains(ch)){
					break;
				}
				else {
					substring.add(ch);
				}	
			}
			maxLength = (substring.size() >= maxLength)?substring.size():maxLength;
		}
		return maxLength;
	}

```

My solution is straightforward. Iterate the string, find the longest substring.
Firstly, find the longest substring that starts with first character String.charAt(0), then compare with maxLength, if greater than maxLength, then replace the value of maxLength.

Then, iterate the operation as above. Finding the longest substring that starts with sencond character, third character, ... until the last character. Afterwards, get the maximum value among  lengths of those substrings.

[Introver or Extrobvert or Ambivert](https://medium.com/taking-note/introvert-or-extrovert-heres-how-to-boost-your-productivity-94fce2d1c39)

Here is link for testing your pernal type: [Personal type quizz](https://ideas.ted.com/quiz-are-you-an-extrovert-introvert-or-ambivert/) 


Tips for each personal type to maximize their producitivity.


**Introverts**:
* Control your environment: Seek out a calm office where you can concentrate and focus on your own stuff.
* Focus on one-on-one interactions: Making time for more meaningful conversation in one-on-on settings. Meet teammates individually and have a solo chat to improve yoour comfort level
* Slow down: If you don't speak up, your team will never know it takes time when really think through a proble. Communicate properly with your manager and raise hand for project that align with deeper thinking.
* Prepare for meetings: motivate yourself for a meeting, review the agenda ahead of time and jot down things that you want to say. Make sure to get them in early meeting since meeting can easily go-off topic as they process.

**Extrovert**
* Embrace the busy, but be careful: set your own boundaries and don't burn out.
* Block off time for relection: After a big milestone, block around 30 mins to think through what worked, what didn't work, and analyze result.

**Ambiverts**
* Leverage your flexibility: consider the styles of the people you interact with and stay flexible so you can meet your own needs without comprising theirs.

Tip for all:
**Do not get too comfortable**

##### Way to obtain Streams intance
Java 8 provides three stream primitive data type, namely, `IntStream`, `DoubleStream`, `LongStream`; and the stream object `Stream` class.

Many other ways to obtain the instance of these streams:
1. Using `stream()` and `paralleStream()` method of collection like List, Set, etc. e.g. `List.stream() and List.parallelStream()`. For ´map´, steams can be obtained by using `Map.entrySet().Stream()` and `Map.entrySet().parallelStream()`.
2. Using `Arrays.stream method`, e.g. `Arrays.stram(int[] array)`
3. Using `Stream.of(Object[] array)`
4. Using `Random` class to obtain streams of random number for primitive data type. `Random.ints()` returns `IntStream`, `Random.longs()` returns `LongStream`, `Random.doubles()` returns `DoubleStream`.
5. `BufferedReader.line()` returns a string steam
6. `Bitset.stream()` returns a IntSteam
7. `Pattern.splitAsStream(CharSequence input)` return a pattern-matched string stream



#### Tip
Making cucumber water is pretty simple:

1. Slice a cleaned, peeled (or unpeeled depending on your preference) cucumber into 1/2 inch slices.
2. Combine cucumber slices in water, and type with ice. Allow to marinate for at least an hour. (For best results, allow it to marinate overnight in the refrigerator.)
